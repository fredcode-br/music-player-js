## Comments

This project was made with the intention of learning about JavaScript. Some changes were made in relation to the creator's project, adding parameters for returning and advancing songs, maintaining the current playback state (paused or playing), in addition to returning to the first song when reaching the end, or going to the last music if you press the button to go back to the first song in the album.
